<!-- PROJECT DESCRIPTION -->

# 📖 Web Metrix currency Exchange<a name="about-project"></a>

 I developed a Currency conversion App using React,Redux  and APIs. This project aims to create a simple and intuitive interface that allows users to search their top currency even cryptocurrencies for conversion rate.👌 Builds the app for production to the build folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
